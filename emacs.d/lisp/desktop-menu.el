;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides a *Desktop Menu* for managing multiple Emacs
;; desktops, possibly in a single directory.
;;
;; Start the menu with `M-x desktop-menu RET'.
;;
;; Press `?' for help in the Desktop Menu.

;; Olaf speaketh:
;;
;;   Why a Desktop Menu?
;;   The Emacs package `desktop' is a really nice menu for saving and
;;   reading various Emacs desktops in different directories.
;;   But often I have the problems:
;;   - I want to save various Emacs desktops in the same directory and
;;   - I lost the overview for directories with a Emacs desktop.
;;   So I've developed a menu which handles various Emacs desktops
;;   in one directory and I can give each desktop a nice name.

;; Compatibility note:
;;
;; Unfortunately, while testing the autosave feature, I found out that XEmacs'
;; `desktop-read' doesn't take an argument, which makes this package pretty
;; much useless. Thus, no effort is currently made to make it compatible with
;; XEmacs.

;;; Customization:

;; There is a customization group called `desktop-menu' in group `desktop'.
;; Start customization by `M-x customize-group RET desktop-menu RET'.
;; You might also want to customize some standard `desktop' variables,
;; such as `desktop-load-locked-desktop'.

;;; History:

;; 0.2
;; - Olaf's last version <http://www.geekware.de/software/emacs/desktop-menu.el>
;;
;; 1.0
;; - fix a number of language issues, function/variable naming and code cleanup,
;;   sync with current GNU Emacs API, fix some docstrings
;; - use `with-temp-buffer' to not leave behind a *Desktop Menu ttt* buffer
;; - fix keyword highlighting regexp
;; - display "Buffer" or "Buffers" according to the actual number of buffers in
;;   a desktop
;;
;; 1.1
;; - `desktop-menu-autosave'
;; - `desktop-menu-list-desktop-buffers' (bound to `l' by default)
;; - `desktop-menu-visit' (bound to `v' by default)
;; - make the key bindings more in line with similar Emacs interfaces;
;;   unfortunately that means `desktop-menu-new' no longer has a nice mnemonic;
;;   it's bound to `o' by default (think Gnus ;-))
;; - mention other customization variables
;; - add History section
;; - other minor fixes

;;; Todo:

;; - improve and extend `desktop-menu-list-desktop-buffers' ("cherry-picking"
;;   a buffer into current desktop, desktop contents editing functionality?)
